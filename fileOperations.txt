Hello world
welcome to programming
this is a text file

Mode of writing files :
"r" -> used for reading files
"w" -> used to write in files, old data is cleared
"x" -> used to create a new file and write in to it
"a" -> used to write to a existing file
"t" -> by default opens in text Mode
"b" -> used to open binary files
"+" -> open a disk for updating (reading and writing)
"r+" -> used to read and write
"w+" -> used to clear the data and rewrite. used to read the re-written data
"a+" -> used to read and write without losing previous data
thanks
